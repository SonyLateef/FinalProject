Final term project submission that uses machine learning methods to predict if a borrower may default on a loan. 
Prediction results are binarized (0 or 1) with training data that includes each potential borrower represented
by a set of features. Each row in the training data file contained the features of a borrower and a target value (0/1).
Sequences of preprocessing, exploration, and evaluation of training and test data were applied to consider large datasets and complex models.
Models that were used in this project included AdaBoostClassifier, Support Vector Machines, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron.
Results were evaluated by the AUC.
